# FriendTrips

#### About

*FriendTrips* is a web-app to help groups of friends who live all across the country find affordable flight destinations using the Skyscanner API. 

A user first selects their departure and return dates, as well as the departing airports for each traveller, and then is presented with a list of destinations, their total cost, and the evenly distributed cost per person for the trip. The user can then select the destination they prefer and view flight details for each person. From there, the user can choose to book the trip and send iternaries to their friends.

*FriendTrips* was built with a two day time limit as an entry in the 2019 Austin Women Who Code Diversity Hackathon. http://www.friendtrips.world/

### Technical Challenges/What We Learned:

* “SSL certification with .crt, .ca0-bundle, and .key files is really hard”
* “Learning more about the intricacies about Material UI and using event defaults for data needed for dialog boxes”
* “You can fire off an array of Promises sequentially by using reduce! (Fun Fact: Promise.all doesn’t necessarily fire off promises in order)”
* “The required specificity of POST request objects and connecting the client to your server”
* "The importance of error handling on the front end to account for incomplete API results"
* "Delivering a functional application from idea to implementation to deployment within the scope and time constraints of a weekend, and the excellent team communication needed in order to achieve it"
* "Not all bundles are bundles of joy"
